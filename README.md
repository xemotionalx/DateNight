# Date Night
Your romance is one of a kind... your date night should be too.

## About the App
There are plenty of dating apps out there to help you find the one... but what about when you've already found them?? This app allows the user to find local dining and event recommendations based on their and their partner's personality type.

## Overview
This is a frontend web application. First, the user takes a quiz that sorts them into a "type" based on their responses. This type is saved to local storage, and is used to alter which date options are displayed. It uses the Eventbrite, Mealsdb and Zomato APIs to find information based on curated picks and location.

## Patches & Updates
As of December 2019, the Eventbrite API was deprecated, which made the "events" section of the app nonfunctional. This will soon be updated once a suitable replacement API is found.
